PROJECT TITLE : LOCATION-BASED-AUGUMENTED EXPERIENCE(METAVERSE MIRROR)

The Location-Based Augmented Reality Experience Application is an innovative project that leverages Nianticâ€™s Lightship ARDK and Unity to create immersive AR experiences. The application uses 3D spatial mapping to scan and reconstruct real-world locations, enabling the placement of persistent virtual objects anchored to specific locations. These objects remain accessible and interactable, providing an enhanced real-world experience.
The application targets diverse use cases, including tourism, education, and retail. For instance, users visiting historical landmarks can view AR-based reconstructions, while shoppers can visualize virtual objects in physical spaces. This application demonstrates the potential of AR to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, offering an engaging and interactive platform.
The project includes environment scanning, 3D mesh integration, spatial anchoring, and AR object interaction, all optimized for mobile deployment. It ensures accurate object placement, robust performance across various environments, and a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used:

Lightship ARDK: For 3D mapping and spatial anchoring
Unity: For application development and AR feature integration
Wayfarer: For real-world location scanning
Android Platform: For deployment
This project stands out by providing persistent and location-specific AR experiences without the need for markers, making it versatile and adaptable for various industries
